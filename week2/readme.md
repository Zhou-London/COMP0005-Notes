# COMP0005 Note for week2

Zhouzhou Zhang, Jan 21

## Array

Array is an ADT where we do care about what elements does it have and whether they are accessible. The basic operations can be defined as following.

    set(index, element)
    get(index)

List is an ADT where we only care whether the elements are in a sequence, or may say, in a fixed order. The basic operations can be defined as following. In C++, there is std::<list>. Note that list is not efficient for indexing.

    append(item)
    perpend(item)
    head()
    tail()

## Queue

First in First out

## Stack

First in Last out

## So...

Yeah that's it. There is nothing worth learning in week2. I know
many of you have learned this thing before.
